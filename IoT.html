              <h2>5. IoT Security Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                The rapid adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought numerous benefits, but it has also introduced significant security risks. Since IoT devices are interconnected and collect vast amounts of sensitive data, they become prime targets for cyberattacks. One major challenge is the lack of strong security protocols in many IoT devices. Manufacturers often prioritize affordability and ease of use over security, leading to devices with weak encryption, default passwords, and outdated software. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or launch large-scale cyberattacks.<br><br>
        
                Another critical challenge is the high risk of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Cybercriminals can hijack poorly secured IoT devices and turn them into a botnet to flood networks with massive amounts of traffic, causing downtime and disruption. A well-known example is the Mirai botnet attack, where thousands of compromised IoT devices were used to disable major websites and services. Additionally, data privacy concerns arise as IoT devices continuously collect personal information, including health records, location data, and home security footage. If these devices are not properly secured, sensitive data can be leaked or misused.<br><br>

                IoT security is also challenged by difficulty in updating and patching vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional computers and smartphones, many IoT devices lack automatic update mechanisms, making them vulnerable to newly discovered threats. Once a device is deployed, it may remain exposed for years without receiving security patches. To address these challenges, strong encryption, multi-factor authentication, regular software updates, and network segmentation must be implemented. Governments and organizations are also working on creating IoT security standards to ensure safer deployments in smart homes, healthcare, industrial systems, and critical infrastructures.
